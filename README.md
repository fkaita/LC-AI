# L/C-AI

AI-powered L/C transaction system

## Background

The Letter of Credit (L/C) plays a crucial role in international trade transactions, yet its document preparation and review processes incur significant costs. We propose automating these processes with AI, enabling automated drafting of L/C applications, issuance, and review. This new approach will not only reduce costs and accelerate the process, but also allow stakeholders to focus on delivery and quality assurance, which are essential in international trade.
