| IT001_Security           | Reject     | The application proposes to procure Adobe Illustrator licenses via Yahoo Auctions. There is no mention of any security features like encryption or MFA, and the version (CS2) is outdated with no active support or security updates from Adobe. This poses significant security risks. |
| IT002_Vendor Reliability | Reject     | The vendor (Yahoo Auctions seller) does not provide transparent SLAs or formal support guarantees. Additionally, the Adobe CS2 version is no longer supported by Adobe, raising concerns about reliability and future service continuity.                                               |
| IT003_Cost Efficiency    | Reject     | Although the cost is low, there is no clear evidence of ROI or value. The outdated software may incur hidden costs related to security vulnerabilities, lack of support, and potential non-compliance issues.                                                                           |
| IT004_Compliance         | Reject     | The proposal involves purchasing licenses from a third-party seller on Yahoo Auctions. This raises concerns about the legitimacy and compliance of the licenses with Adobe's terms of use. Additionally, the CS2 version is outdated and may not meet corporate licensing requirements. |```

## Feedback

### Feedback for Applicant: Iwashi Sanma

Your proposal demonstrates a clear understanding of the department’s needs for professional design tools, which is commendable. However, procuring outdated software from an unreliable source poses significant security, compliance, and reliability risks.

**Suggestions:**
1. **Updated Software**: Opt for the latest version of Adobe Illustrator directly from Adobe or authorized resellers to ensure security and support.
2. **Compliance**: Ensure all software purchases comply with Adobe's licensing terms to avoid legal issues.
3. **Security**: Prioritize software with regular updates and robust security features to protect company data.
4. **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Conduct a detailed ROI analysis for purchasing updated software to justify the investment.
