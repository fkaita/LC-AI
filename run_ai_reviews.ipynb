      "1. **Address of the Applicant (Buyer):**\n",
      "   - **L/C Application:** 5678 Shibuya Street, Tokyo 150-0001, Japan\n",
      "   - **Sales Contract:** 5678 Shibuya Street, Tokyo 150-0002, Japan\n",
      "   - **Discrepancy:** The postal code for the address of the applicant differs between the L/C application (150-0001) and the sales contract (150-0002).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Currency & Amount of Credit:**\n",
      "   - **L/C Application:**\n",
      "     - (Figures): USD 1,600,00\n",
      "     - (Words): USD one million and six hundred thousand\n",
      "   - **Sales Contract:**\n",
      "     - Total Contract Value: USD 1,600,000\n",
      "   - **Discrepancy:** There is a typographical error in the figures mentioned in the L/C application. It states “USD 1,600,00” instead of “USD 1,600,000”.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Considerations:\n",
      "1. **Names of Applicant and Beneficiary:**\n",
      "   - The names and addresses of both the Applicant (XYZ Imports Ltd.) and the Beneficiary (ABC Trading Co.) otherwise match correctly between the L/C application and the sales contract, aside from the postal code discrepancy noted above.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Currency & Amount in Words:**\n",
      "   - The amount in words in the L/C application correctly matches the total contract value as stated in the sales contract.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendations:\n",
      "1. **Correct the Postal Code:**\n",
      "   - Ensure that the postal code for XYZ Imports Ltd. is consistent between the L/C application and the sales contract. Confirm whether the correct postal code is 150-0001 or 150-0002 and update the document accordingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Correct the Figures in the L/C Application:**\n",
      "   - Amend the figure in the L/C application from “USD 1,600,00” to “USD 1,600,000” to accurately reflect the total contract value and eliminate any potential confusion or rejection of the L/C due to this error.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion:\n",
      "The discrepancies identified need to be addressed promptly to ensure that the L/C application aligns perfectly with the sales contract. Corrections should be made to the postal code of the applicant and the figure of the credit amount in the L/C application. Once these discrepancies are rectified, the L/C application will be consistent with the provided sales contract.\n"
